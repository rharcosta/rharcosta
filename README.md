# âš¡ Welcome, buddy! âš¡

My name is Rubia Helena Archanjo, I'm from Brazil and I'm in the third year of **Computer Engineering** college at Facamp - Campinas. I've been working with Technology since 2016 when I did my **Information Technology** at CEMEP - PaulÃ­nia. Nowadays I'm diversifying my curriculum, learning new subjects and improves the ones I already know. ğŸ’¬ Feel free to suggest improvements and corrections and ask me questions. I love learning new things so much it hurts ğŸ¤”. The world is already wonderful, but it's even more interesting with computers and programming.
